        <p>I (Eric Thomas Schneider) was born on May 1st, 2000, in Charlotte, North Carolina to Deborah and Paul Schneider. I was raised in Weddington, North Carolina, attending Weddington Elementary School, Weddington Middle School, and Weddington High School. I ran on the cross country and track teams in middle school and high school.</p>
        <p>I recently (May 2023) graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am starting my Masters of Science in Computer Science in fall 2023.</p>
        <p>I enjoy (casual) bodybuilding and long distance (marathon/half) running. I've run 7 marathons, with <a href="https://results.raceroster.com/v2/en-US/results/g39ey4js9ncsxz5r/detail/bwqy2xucqy75gpt4">my fastest being 3:10:32</a>. I don't measure maxs, but I like to pretend I can bench two plates (225 lb), and squat/deadlift more than that (hard to guess because of injuries).</p>
        <p>I occasionally like to play video games, though I'm not very good at them. My favorites are Minecraft, Cube 2: Sauerbraten, Bloons Tower Defense 6, and Civilizations V. Modded Minecraft is actually what got me into programming and thus computer science (see "Projects").</p>
        <p>I am interested in international politics and affairs, and I keep up with world news closely. I like cats, and love my parents' cats, Trixie and Scout.</p>
        <p>Although I am deeply invested in computer science and software engineering, my real dream is to lead an alternative band. So far, I have made absolutely no progress towards this goal.</p>
