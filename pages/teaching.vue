        <p>As both a graduate and undergraduate teaching assistant, I have four years of experience teaching.</p>
        <h2>Graduate Teaching Assistant (UNC Chapel Hill)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~swali/comp520/">COMP 520: Compilers</a></strong> (spring 2024), with fellow graduate student Syed Ali.</li>
          <li><strong>COMP 211: System Fundamentals</strong> (fall 2023), under Professor Brent Munsell. This was a split semester (I worked 10 hours for COMP 211, plus 10 hours for COMP 530).</li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/courses/comp530/f23/">COMP 530: Operating Systems</a></strong> (fall 2023), under Professor Don Porter.</li>

        <h2>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UNC Chapel Hill)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>COMP 211: System Fundamentals</strong> (spring 2023), under Professor Brent Munsell.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/courses/comp530/f22/">COMP 530: Operating Systems</a></strong> (fall 2022), under Professor Don Porter.</li>
          <li><strong>COMP 211: System Fundamentals</strong> (spring 2022), under Professor Ketan Mayer-Patel.</li>
          <li><strong>COMP 211: System Fundamentals</strong> (fall 2021), under Professor Brent Munsell. This semester, I was promoted to "lead UTA", managing labs for the course. I created a new lab, the MIPS simulator lab, which has still been used to this day.</li>
          <li><strong>COMP 211: System Fundamentals</strong> (spring 2021), under Professor Brent Munsell.</li>
          <li><strong>COMP 211: System Fundamentals</strong> (fall 2020), under Professor Kris Jordan. Notably, me and two other UTAs made a <a href="https://comp211-20f.github.io/">study website</a> for this course, which is still a useful systems reference.</li>
