					<li class="proj-active proj-mw proj-html"><a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/FTB_Wiki">Official FTB Wiki</a>. Basically, the Official FTB Wiki is an online publicly edited wiki that documents the world of modded Minecraft, including mods, modpacks, and other third-party content for Minecraft. I've poured a lot of time into this one. In 2014, I started documenting my own mod (Nuclear Control 2), and I got so far into documenting that I started documenting other people's mods. Now I'm an administrator and I have over 50,000 edits on the wiki. I used to edit each day and make a lot of new articles. Nowadays, not so much. However, I still check up on it and do administrative tasks. Contributing to the wiki has involved:
					<ul>
						<li>Writing and editing content in an encyclopedic tone using MediaWiki.</li>
						<li>Analyzing Java (and rarely Scala/Kotlin) to obtain information for the wiki.</li>
						<li>Engaging with other editors on various platforms.</li>
						<li>Creating and modifying templates and other wiki components, using wikitext, Lua, JavaScript, and CSS.</li>
						<li>Developing third party tools and scripts to deal with wiki management tasks, usually in Ruby, occasionally in Java and Groovy (see other projects).</li>
						<li>Refining wiki guidelines/help, managing the translation projects, community management (including managing the Discord, appearing in virtual events, and organizing editathons).</li>

					<li class="proj-inactive proj-java"><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclear-control-2">Nuclear Control 2</a>. Nuclear Control 2 is an addon to a Minecraft mod called IndustrialCraft 2. It is also a fork of Nuclear Control, originally created by Shedar. It helps players monitor their nuclear reactors, but it might be more famous for the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Advanced_Information_Panel">Advanced Information Panel</a> and the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Howler_Alarm">Howler Alarm</a>, the latter of which can be used to annoy unfortunate victims for hours on end. I ported it, with collaboration from Zuxelus and dmf444, from Minecraft 1.6.2 to 1.7.2 to 1.7.10. Pyrolusite modernized the art. We made some changes/improvements to the mod, which are documented <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/IC2_Nuclear_Control/Changelog">here</a>. Nuclear Control 2 is currently discontinued and replaced by a new mod, World Control (see below). Made in Java. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Nuclear-Control">here</a>. Project status: <span class="proj-discontinued-c">Discontinued</span>.</li>
					<li class="proj-inactive proj-rb"><a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Experimental-Self-Aware-Electronic-Based-Space-Analyzing-Droid">ESAEBSAD</a>. ESAEBSAD is an IRC bot that can be used to manipulate wiki content, as well as perform some silly commands. Its more useful functions include the find-replace command, the double redirect fixer, and the translated categories generator. I wrote this in Ruby, and you can say it worked out pretty well, since it convinced my fellow administrator Eli to rewrite his bot in Ruby instead of Perl. Since we stopped using IRC, ESAEBSAD was replaced by ESAEBSAD2, which is being replaced with ESAEBSAD3. Project status: <span class="proj-discontinued-c">Discontinued</span>.</li>

                    <li class="proj-inactive proj-rust"><a href="https://devpost.com/software/limp">Limp</a>. Limp is a a Lisp-like programming language implemented in Rust I made for PackHacks 2021, with some contributions from Chongyi Zheng. I really wanted to create a language from scratch, as well as get some more Rust use. The language is very much a toy language, missing many important constructs, but it has a few powerful features, including conditionals, boolean logic, basic integer/float operations, and bitwise operations. I would like to add a bit more to it, but it is considered complete as a prototype and a toy language. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/limp">here</a>. Project status: <span class="proj-complete-c">Complete for now</span>.</li> <!-- March -->
					<li class="proj-inactive proj-java"><a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/520-compiler">miniJava Compiler</a>. This was a school project to create a compiler for a subset of Java. My compiler supports basic integer and boolean operations, arrays, basic control logic, and some level of OOP. I completed the assignment but did not complete all extra credit parts; there's support for field initialization, constructors, for loops, and some level of broken support for overloading. Although I would like to return to finish overloading, more likely I will start a new compiler at some point.

					<li class="proj-inactive proj-rust"><a href="https://devpost.com/software/betterthanvim">BetterThanVim</a>. BetterThanVim is an <code>ed</code>-like command line command-based text editor that I made for queer_hack 2020. This was a conceptual idea that was especially interesting to me, so I decided to work on it alone. It's written in Rust. I might clean up it later but I consider this to be finished as it works and completes the general concept. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/queerhack2020">here</a>.

					<li class="proj-inactive proj-html proj-sql"><a href="https://tar-heel-calendar.herokuapp.com/">Tar Heel Calendar</a>. This was created by me, Victoria Hoffman, Alfred Mathew, and Ezri White for our COMP 426: Modern Web Programming final. It is a calendar/scheduling website. Because it's on Heroku, it may take a while to come online if it hasn't been used in a while. The frontend uses HTML5, React.js, Bulma, and axios, while the backend (which I was in charge of) uses Node.js, express, MariaDB, the mysql NPM package, and Heroku.

It is a website for the course, with links to all the lectures and resources, plus some extra resources. It's a static website, using HTML5 and Bulma.

It allows users to upload a midi file, using machine learning to generate a continuation of it. It wasn't really finished (and we did not win), because we put too much importance into getting a goodnight's sleep, but it was interesting to make. On the frontend, which I was in charge of, we used HTML5, React.js, and Bulma, and on the backend, we used Python, Flask, Music21, Keras, and Google Cloud.

It's a 11 page paper, presentation, and GitHub repo (with coding in MATLAB). The link is to GitHub which has links to the other components of the project in the README. Project status: <span class="proj-complete-c">Complete</span>.</li><!-- Jun -->
					<li class="proj-inactive proj-csharp"><a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/breath-8">Breath</a>. This is a game made in Unity (using C#) which is a submission to the Global Game Jam (2020). The goal is to not run out of oxygen. Farts lower the oxygen level by a lot. Having the mouth closed will slowly deplete oxygen, while having it open (use the space bar) will slowly bring it back. The longer you last the better your score. It's a bit like Floppy Bird. This was made by me, Richard Pan, and Dylan Binley. I did much of the code and I Photoshopped some assets. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/GGJ2020">here</a>. The GitHub is more updated than the GGJ entry since Richard made some last-minute improvements before we had to present. We probably weren't the best game in the room but we used Unity for the first time and so gained some Unity/C# experience. And like most hackathons, about 10% of the time allocated went to actually working, with 90% of the time going to sleeping, eating, goofing off, pretending to work, going to workshops, etc. Oh well.

					<li class="proj-inactive proj-java"><a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/a8-conway-the-gamer">Conway's Game</a>. Made in Java Swing. This was an extra credit assignment for COMP 401. Although most school assignments aren't noteworthy, I think this one is since I made it from scratch and it has a bunch of cool options. Unfortunately it doesn't work very well in large sizes. Project status: <span class="proj-complete-c">Complete</span>.</li>
					<li class="proj-inactive proj-java"><a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/401hackathon">Ball Game</a>. This is a Java Swing game where the player shoots at ten balls to get points. This was made for a hackathon just for COMP 401 students. We (me, Dylan Binley, Anand Hande) didn't win, probably because the game is genuinely difficult, not super intuitive, and we didn't have time to make it aesthetically pleasing. The gravity is pretty cool. Made in &lt;12 hours. Project status: <span class="proj-complete-c">Complete</span>.</li>
					<li class="proj-inactive proj-java"><a href="https://github.com/a8675309/HackNCSilentDisco0">Language Fun</a> (ignore the repository name). This is an Android app that we (me, Anand Hande, Dylan Binley) made for HackNC. It's our first Android app. The app lets you practice the top 100 most common words in Spanish and French. It's not really complete, and not released. We did not win lol. Made in 24 hours (minus when we slept and goofed off) in Java. Project status: <span class="proj-complete-c">Complete</span>.</li>

World Control was a Minecraft mod written in Java that is a recreation of Nuclear Control 2 for Minecraft 1.10 and 1.12, and without requiring IC2. I was the project manager more or less, although dmf444 has probably taken more initiative than me. Zuxelus started his own fork of the original Nuclear Control called <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/energy-control">Energy Control</a>, which is the unofficial replacement for this mod, since me and the other developers didn't have enough time to work on it.

I originally started it in 2013 I think but I got rid of the original version which was written for Minecraft 1.4.7. I think the last version it was for is Minecraft 1.6.2. Never released. The code is very bad looking. There's some decorative blocks and items. Project status: <span class="proj-abandoned-c">Abandoned</span>.</li><!-- Jan -->
