		<p>This is a list of all of my projects. For a more succinct and useful version, look at my resume instead. This is basically a very expanded version of that. WIP!</p>
		<h3>Main projects</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/FTB_Wiki">Official FTB Wiki</a>. Basically, the Official FTB Wiki is an online publicly edited wiki that documents the world of modded Minecraft, including mods, modpacks, and other third-party content for Minecraft. I've poured a lot of time into this one. In 2014, I started documenting my own mod (Nuclear Control 2), and I got so far into documenting that I started documenting other people's mods. Now I'm an administrator and I have over 50,000 edits on the wiki. I used to edit each day and make a lot of new articles. Nowadays, not so much. However, I still check up on it and do administrative tasks. Contributing to the wiki has involved:
				<ul>
					<li>Writing and editing content in an encyclopedic tone using MediaWiki.</li>
					<li>Analyzing Java (and rarely Scala/Kotlin) to obtain information for the wiki.</li>
					<li>Engaging with other editors on various platforms.</li>
					<li>Creating and modifying templates and other wiki components, using WikiText, Lua, JavaScript, and CSS.</li>
					<li>Developing third party tools and scripts to deal with wiki management tasks, usually in Ruby, occasionally in Java and Groovy (see other projects).</li>
					<li>Refining wiki guidelines/help, managing the translation projects, community management (including managing the Discord, appearing in virtual events, and organizing editathons).</li>
				</ul>

			<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclear-control-2">Nuclear Control 2</a>. Nuclear Control 2 is an addon to a Minecraft mod called IndustrialCraft 2. It is also a fork of Nuclear Control, originally created by Shedar. It helps players monitor their nuclear reactors, but it might be more famous for the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Advanced_Information_Panel">Advanced Information Panel</a> and the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Howler_Alarm">Howler Alarm</a>, the latter of which can be used to annoy unfortunate victims for hours on end. I ported it, with collaboration from Zuxelus and dmf444, from Minecraft 1.6.2 to 1.7.2 to 1.7.10. Pyrolusite modernized the art. We made some changes/improvements to the mod, which are documented <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/IC2_Nuclear_Control/Changelog">here</a>. Nuclear Control 2 is currently discontinued and replaced by a new mod, World Control (see below). Made in Java. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Nuclear-Control">here</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Experimental-Self-Aware-Electronic-Based-Space-Analyzing-Droid">ESAEBSAD</a>. ESAEBSAD is an IRC bot that can be used to manipulate wiki content as well as perform some silly commands. Its more useful functions include the find-replace command, the double redirect fixer, and the translated categories generator. I wrote this in Ruby, and you can say it worked out pretty well, since I convinced fellow administrator Eli to rewrite his bot in Ruby instead of Perl. Since we stopped using IRC, ESAEBSAD is currently discontinued, and henceforth replaced by ESAEBSAD2.</li>

		<h3>2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This website! Yep. Written in basic old HTML and CSS. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/eric-unc.github.io">here</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/a8-conway-the-gamer">Conway's Game</a>. Made in Java Swing. This was an extra credit assignment. Most school assignments aren't noteworthy but this one is since it took a long time and is kinda cool. It has a bunch of cool options but it doesn't work very well in very large sizes.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/401hackathon">Ball Game</a>. This is a Java Swing game where the player shoots at ten balls to get points. This was made for a hackathon just for COMP 401 students. We (me, Dylan Binley, Anand Honde) didn't win, probably because the game is genuinely difficult, not super intuitive, and we didn't have time to make it aesthically pleasing. The gravity is pretty cool. Made in <nohtml><</nohtml>12 hours.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/a8675309/HackNCSilentDisco0">Language Fun</a> (ignore the repository name). This is an Android app that we (me, Anand Honde, Dylan Binley) made for HackNC. It's our first Android app. The app lets you practice the top 100 most common words in Spanish and French. It's not really complete, and not released. We did not win lol. Made in 24 hours (minus when we slept and goofed off) in Java.</li>
