		<p>This is a list of all of my projects. For a more succinct and useful version, look at my resume instead. This is basically a very expanded version of that. WIP!</p>
		<p>TODO: figure out the best way to categorize (and color-code) the projects by activity. Maybe make a filter in JavaScript based off that.</p>
		<h3>Main projects</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="proj-active"><a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/FTB_Wiki">Official FTB Wiki</a>. Basically, the Official FTB Wiki is an online publicly edited wiki that documents the world of modded Minecraft, including mods, modpacks, and other third-party content for Minecraft. I've poured a lot of time into this one. In 2014, I started documenting my own mod (Nuclear Control 2), and I got so far into documenting that I started documenting other people's mods. Now I'm an administrator and I have over 50,000 edits on the wiki. I used to edit each day and make a lot of new articles. Nowadays, not so much. However, I still check up on it and do administrative tasks. Contributing to the wiki has involved:
				<ul>
					<li>Writing and editing content in an encyclopedic tone using MediaWiki.</li>
					<li>Analyzing Java (and rarely Scala/Kotlin) to obtain information for the wiki.</li>
					<li>Engaging with other editors on various platforms.</li>
					<li>Creating and modifying templates and other wiki components, using WikiText, Lua, JavaScript, and CSS.</li>
					<li>Developing third party tools and scripts to deal with wiki management tasks, usually in Ruby, occasionally in Java and Groovy (see other projects).</li>
					<li>Refining wiki guidelines/help, managing the translation projects, community management (including managing the Discord, appearing in virtual events, and organizing editathons).</li>
				</ul>

			<li class="proj-inactive proj-discontinued"><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclear-control-2">Nuclear Control 2</a>. Nuclear Control 2 is an addon to a Minecraft mod called IndustrialCraft 2. It is also a fork of Nuclear Control, originally created by Shedar. It helps players monitor their nuclear reactors, but it might be more famous for the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Advanced_Information_Panel">Advanced Information Panel</a> and the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Howler_Alarm">Howler Alarm</a>, the latter of which can be used to annoy unfortunate victims for hours on end. I ported it, with collaboration from Zuxelus and dmf444, from Minecraft 1.6.2 to 1.7.2 to 1.7.10. Pyrolusite modernized the art. We made some changes/improvements to the mod, which are documented <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/IC2_Nuclear_Control/Changelog">here</a>. Nuclear Control 2 is currently discontinued and replaced by a new mod, World Control (see below). Made in Java. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Nuclear-Control">here</a>. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-discontinued-c">Discontinued</span>.</li>
			<li class="proj-inactive proj-discontinued"><a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Experimental-Self-Aware-Electronic-Based-Space-Analyzing-Droid">ESAEBSAD</a>. ESAEBSAD is an IRC bot that can be used to manipulate wiki content as well as perform some silly commands. Its more useful functions include the find-replace command, the double redirect fixer, and the translated categories generator. I wrote this in Ruby, and you can say it worked out pretty well, since it convinced fellow administrator Eli to rewrite his bot in Ruby instead of Perl. Since we stopped using IRC, ESAEBSAD is henceforth replaced by ESAEBSAD2. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-discontinued-c">Discontinued</span>.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="proj-inactive proj-complete"><a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/breath-8">Breath</a>. This is a game made in Unity (using C#) which is a submission to the Global Game Jam (2020). The goal is to not run out of oxygen. Farts lower the oxygen level by a lot. Having the mouth closed will slowly deplete oxygen, while having it open (use the space bar) will slowly bring it back. The longer you last the better your score. It's a bit like Floppy Bird. This was made by me, Richard Pan, and Dylan Binley. I did much of the code and I Photoshopped some assets. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/GGJ2020">here</a>. The GitHub is more updated than the GGJ entry since Richard made some last-minute improvements before we had to present. We probably weren't the best game in the room but we used Unity for the first time and so gained some Unity/C# experience. And like most hackathons, about 10% of the time allocated went to actually working, with 90% of the time going to sleeping, eating, goofying off, pretending to work, going to workshops, etc. Oh well. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-complete-c">Complete</span>.</li><!-- late Jan-->
			<li class="proj-active">This website! Yep. Written in basic old HTML and CSS. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/eric-unc.github.io">here</a>. Project status: <span class="proj-active-c">Actively working on</span>.</li><!--Jan-->
		</ul>
		<h3>2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="proj-inactive proj-complete"><a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/a8-conway-the-gamer">Conway's Game</a>. Made in Java Swing. This was an extra credit assignment for COMP 401. Most school assignments aren't noteworthy but I think this one is since I made it from scratch and it has a bunch of cool options. Unfortunately it doesn't work very well in large sizes. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-complete-c">Complete</span>.</li>
			<li class="proj-inactive proj-complete"><a href="https://github.com/eric-unc/401hackathon">Ball Game</a>. This is a Java Swing game where the player shoots at ten balls to get points. This was made for a hackathon just for COMP 401 students. We (me, Dylan Binley, Anand Honde) didn't win, probably because the game is genuinely difficult, not super intuitive, and we didn't have time to make it aesthically pleasing. The gravity is pretty cool. Made in <nohtml><</nohtml>12 hours. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-complete-c">Complete</span>.</li>
			<li class="proj-inactive proj-complete"><a href="https://github.com/a8675309/HackNCSilentDisco0">Language Fun</a> (ignore the repository name). This is an Android app that we (me, Anand Honde, Dylan Binley) made for HackNC. It's our first Android app. The app lets you practice the top 100 most common words in Spanish and French. It's not really complete, and not released. We did not win lol. Made in 24 hours (minus when we slept and goofed off) in Java. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-complete-c">Complete</span>.</li>
			<li class="proj-inactive proj-complete"><a href="https://gist.github.com/xbony2/28908b42ec3851c6141787dd81ff1bbf">Coabot</a>. It's an exercise planner made in Ruby made for personal use. I never really used it though. I believe I made since I didn't have anything to do in my online art appreciation class. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-complete-c">Complete</span>.</li><!--before Jun-->

		<h3>2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="proj-inactive proj-discontinued"><a href="https://github.com/xbony2/ESAEBSAD2">ESAEBSAD2</a>. A Discord bot written in Groovy to replace ESAEBSAD. Currently being worked on. It isn't on a server just yet. I technically started this in early 2018 but didn't really do much until late 2019. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-discontinued-c">Discontinued</span>.</li><!--Feb-->
		</ul>
		<h3>2017</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="proj-inactive"><a href="https://help.gamepedia.com/Gamepedia_Rapid_Anti-Spam_Patrol">Gamepedia Rapid Anti-Spam Patrol (GRASP)</a>. This is an initiative across Gamepedia to revert vandalism (spam is pretty rare) across wikis. I was appointed a GRASP member and still am one, although I'm not very active. When I was active I patrolled like 10-20 wikis a day to check for vandalism. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c">Inactive</span>.</li><!--Sep-->
			<li class="proj-inactive proj-complete"><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/long-fall-boots">Long Fall Boots</a>. Ported/recreated small mod from Minecraft 1.11 to 1.12.2 in Java. Now updated to the latest version of Minecraft, 1.15. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Long-Fall-Boots">here</a>. Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-complete-c">Complete</span> (until the next update).</li><!--Aug-->
			<li class="proj-active"><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/huesodewiki">HuesoDeWiki</a>. HuesoDeWiki is a Minecraft mod created by me in Java to create a base page of blocks and items in the game. It also has a command to copy structures in a <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Template:Cg/Multiblock/Alt">{{Cg/Multiblock/Alt}}</a> format but Hubry made that part. Semi-actived maintained (I need to port it to 1.15). GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xbony2/HuesoDeWiki">here</a>. Project status: <span class="proj-active-c">Will be working on shortly</span>.</li><!--Jan-->
		</ul>
		<h3>2016</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="proj-active"><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockrenderer">BlockRenderer</a>. BlockRenderer is a Minecraft mod created by unascribed used to dump renders of blocks and items. We use it at the FTB Wiki to make tilesheets. I ported the mod from Minecraft 1.10 to 1.11, and I am currently working on porting it from Minecraft 1.12 to 1.15. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xbony2/BlockRenderer">here</a> (my fork). Project status: <span class="proj-active-c">Working on</span>.</li><!--Dec-->
			<li class="proj-inactive proj-complete"><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bonemealable-babies">Bonemealable babies</a>. Don't DuckDuckGo this term. This is a small joke mod for Minecraft written in Java (there was a test port in Groovy but it had issues) that allows baby animals to be grown by right-clicking them with Bone Meal. Now updated to the latest version of Minecraft. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Bonemealable-babies">here</a>.  Project status: <span class="proj-inactive-c proj-complete-c">Complete</span> (until the next update).</li><!--Aug-->
			<li><a href="https://github.com/elifoster/TheModdingTrials">BunnyTech</a>. BunnyTech is a small Minecraft mod made in Java by me and Eli Foster during The Modding Trials, a mod-making competition. I tried to make a TESLA-based Basic Generator (which burned Coal) but it didn't work. Eli successfully made a <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Bunny%27s_Tail">Bunny's Tail</a> that lets the player jump. We didn't win. Mod is abandoned.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/FTB-Gamepedia/ATT-9001">ATT-9001</a> (aka Auto Tile Translator 9001). This a tool made in Ruby for the FTB Wiki. Given language files from a mod, it automatically translate tiles registered on the wiki based on those official translations. I haven't used this in a while but it should still work. However, languages files might be in JSON now (?) post Minecraft 1.14 so I may need to make an ATT-9002.</li><!--Jun-->
			<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-control">World Control</a>. World Control is a Minecraft mod written in Java that is a recreation of Nuclear Control 2 for Minecraft 1.10 and 1.12, and without requiring IC2. I am the project manager more or less, although dmf444 has probably taken more initiative than me. Unfortunately, the project is in limbo right now, despite high demand. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/World-Control-Team/World-Control">here</a>.</li><!--May-->
			<li><a href="https://tmole.gamepedia.com/The_Madness_of_Little_Emma_Wiki">The Madness of Little Emma Wiki</a>. This is a wiki that I was the administrator of for a period of time, garnishing over 1500 edits. I made templates and many pages. I am no longer involved. The game is an indie game and not being updated anymore so I don't see much of a reason to return to the wiki.</li>
			<li><a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/MediaWiki:Gadget-toolbar.js">Gadget-toolbar</a>. This is a MediaWiki Gadget written in JavaScript that expands the default WikiEditor to include templates commonly used on the FTB Wiki (infoboxes, crafting grids, etc). Recently fixed.</li><!--Feb-->
		</ul>
		<h3>2015</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/User:Xbony2/common/autosummary.js">autosummary.js</a>. This used to be a pretty basic script but I made it more powerful in 2019. Basically, you can set a default edit summary which is saved via cookies to be used whenever you edit, and you can also toggle that to be on or off as desired. Also if creating a new page, and there's no summary, it will make the default summary "created page" (which was the original use). Made in JavaScript.</li><!--Oct-->
			<li><a href="https://github.com/FTB-Gamepedia/MediaWiki-Butt-Ruby">MediaWiki::Butt</a>. MediaWiki::Butt is a Ruby library/gem that makes it easy to perform wiki actions in Ruby. It's created by Eli Foster, with me as a co-author. Mostly I fixed random stuff, but I also added the random articles function and namespace constants. I used MediaWiki::Butt in ESAEBSAD, ATT-9001, and a bunch of random scripts.</li><!--Sep-->
			<li><a href="https://github.com/xbony2/AntiEndPortalMod">AntiEndPortalMod</a>. This is a small Minecraft mod created by me in Java that disables the creation of the End Portal by the Ender Dragon, and makes the Ender Dragon drop its egg as an item. It's for Minecraft 1.7.10. This was made by request of a friend and never officially released. It's currently unmaintained. It's a simple mod but was hard to implement since I had to use a library called <a href="https://asm.ow2.io/">ASM</a> to manipulate the bytecode at runtime.</li><!--Jul-->
			<li><a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2323075-1-7-10-shinystones-mod-2">Shiny Stones Mod 2</a>. This was a port/recreation of a small mod that I liked from Minecraft 1.6 to 1.7.10. Written in Java. Never was popular; it mostly just adds a few decorative blocks. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Shiny-Stones-2-Mod">here</a>.</li><!--Jan-->
		</ul>
		<h3>2014</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Experimental-Self-Aware-Electronic-Based-Space-Analyzing-Droid">ESAEBSAD</a>. See top.</li><!--Dec-->
			<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flaxbeards-steam-power">Flaxbeard's Steam Power</a>. This a large Minecraft mod made originally by Flaxbeard and maintained by SatanicSanta. I'm a co-author/contributor. I mostly just did bug fixes/code cleanup as well as some crossmod integration, including support IC2 canning of FSP's foods, adding a Steamed Imphide for Natura, cross-FSP-IC2-Natura support for that, and NEI support for the Rock Smasher and Steam Heater. Also introduced some config stuff, helped bring back the Block Placer, and added some Rock Smasher recipes. The newer iteration of this mod is called "Esteemed Innovation" (after the in-game book). I'm no longer involved with the project and it's mostly dead at this point. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Esteemed-Innovation/Esteemed-Innovation">here</a>.</li><!--Oct 19-->
			<li>The <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/afsu-mod">AFSU Mod</a>. This is a small Minecraft mod made by me in Java. It's an addon to IndustrialCraft 2 that adds a 5th tier of energy (EU) storage called the AFSU (the block) and the AFB. Currently the mod is abandoned. Maybe I'll try to port it later. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xbony2/AFSU">here</a>.</li><!--Oct 5-->
			<li>My <a href="https://xbony2.github.io/">original website</a>. This website isn't super great.</li><!--Sep-->
			<li><a href="https://github.com/xbony2/IndustrialEx">IndustrialEx</a>. IndustrialEx is a Minecraft mod created by me in Java that is an addon to IndustrialCraft 2. Unfortunately, I never considered it finished and released it. Currently it's abandoned. This is sad because it had a bunch of cool features, like Nano/Quantum baubles, Natura crops, a rotor made of Dark Steel, and a "hardcore" Macerator recipe.</li><!--Jul-->
			<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclear-control-2">Nuclear Control 2</a>. See top.</li><!--June-->
			<li><a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2076392-modjam4-1-7-bonys-desertcraft">Bony's Desertcraft</a>. Bony's Desertcraft is the first Minecraft mod I released. It has a bunch of cool Desert-related survival items and blocks. It's written in Java and was created for ModJam 4. Currently abandoned. BitBucket is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/xbony2/modjam-4-maybe">here</a>.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/xbony2/Bitm">Bitm</a>. Bitm is my first Minecraft mod, or rather, an extension of it. Written in Java. I originally started it in 2013 I think but I got rid of the original version which was written for Minecraft 1.4.7. I think the last version it was for is Minecraft 1.6.2. Never released. The code is very bad looking. There's some decorative blocks and items.</li><!--Jan-->
