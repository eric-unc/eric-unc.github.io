	<h2>Current activities</h2>
	<p>The pandemic has put a decent in my activities. Currently I run around 30 minutes a day, which is not much. I run with friends, and they pull me back. When on my own I try to run around an hour, sometimes more. Before the pandemic, I did a 3 hour run once a week, and some shorter runs, with trips to the gym between those runs.</p>
	<h2>Personal records</h2>
	<p>I don't really competitively or on a team, so with the exception of the marathon, I won't beat any of these any time soon. (TODO)</p>
