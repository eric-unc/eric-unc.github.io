		<h1 id="title">Politics</h1>
		<p>Congratulations on finding the secret politics page.</p>
		<p>I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">libertarian socialist</a> and a member of the <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Socialists_of_America">Democratic Socialists of America</a>.</p>
		<p>The phrase "libertarian socialism" probably sounds quite contradictory, especially to Americans. The Wikipedia page listed above may absolve some of this confusion. The word "libertarian" has not always be associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-libertarianism">right-wing libertarianism</a>. Traditionally, it has been associated with left-wing anarchism. However, nowadays the phrase is more of an umbrella term for anti-authoritarian socialism. More of what I mean by libertarian socialism is explained below.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time to devote and energy to activism because of my studies and other activities. So is life.</p>
		<h2>My Ideology</h2>
		<p>For me, libertarian socialism is an extension of democracy, to push it as far as possible close to the people, and into everyday life and especially into the workplace. Politics is not merely some abstraction; politics, sociology, economics, and psycology, which are all connected, are part of our fabric of reality. You cannot escape its grasp, even by claiming to be apolitical. This is like claiming to not experience gravity. We are all part of a complicated socioeconomic system, whether we know it or not.</p>
		<p>Libertarian socialists stand in opposition to authoritarianism of all types. Including when such authoritarianism is accepted as-is by society. The workplace is such an example. The relation between the person or people who own a corporation and the people who work for it is hierarchial, and authoritarian. The moment we enter the workplace, we submit ourselves to the iron rule of our bosses, who has near full control over their underlings. We may be able to leave any time we want (although in reality, this is rarely the case), but only to leave to work for somewhere else with another hierarchy.</p>
		<p>Libertarian socialists (like me) will argue that perhaps this structure could be better. If we say we like democracy, then why not try to apply it? This is by no means impossible; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative">worker cooperatives</a> that apply this exact principle exist across the world. In an ideal libertarian socialist world, all workplaces would be self-managed, but worker cooperatives would not just exist in isolation. Instead, they could be coordinated by councils of citizens, rather than being dictated by the market. A decentralized, democratic economy could provide for the needs of all.</p>
		<p>Democracy is best when it is closest the people affected by a decision. Many libertarian socialists are "anti-statist," and oppose a centralized state in favor of localized direct democracy. Personally, I think abolition of the state is too utopian, but I think we should do as much as we can to decentralize political power.</p>
		<p>Lastly, it should be said that the means of survival and basic comfort should be available to all. This is includes healthcare, food, shelter, and medicine.</p>
