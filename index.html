								<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Eric Schneider</strong> (<em>he/him</em>).</p>
								<p>I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and raised in Weddington, North Carolina. I am currently an undergraduate college student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am a double major in Computer Science (BS) and Mathematics (BS). I am a sophomore.</p>
								<p>Welcome to my website! This website is perpetually a work-in-progress, but it's mostly up-to-date. I am currently interested in summer internships as well as undergraduate research opportunities.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Coursework and experience</h2>
				<p>In computer science, my course load is focused around prerequisites, required preparation for the <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/academics/graduate/ms-requirements/">Master of Science</a>, and classes that are generally very applicable (such as COMP 426: Modern Web Programming). In mathematics, my course load is focused around prerequisites. Once those are done, I am hoping to focus on scientific computation and mathematics relevant to the computer science field.</p>
				<p>I am an undergraduate teaching assistant in Systems Fundamentals (COMP 211), an intermediate level computer science class. It teaches programming in the C language and lower-level computer concepts such as data representation, memory management, and parsing, as well as tools.</p>
				<p>I originally gained an appreciation for computer programming through <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Mods">Minecraft modding</a>. Although I am no longer especially active in the scene, I have created, taken over, or contributed towards several Minecraft mods used by many real players. <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclear-control-2">Nuclear Control 2</a> (now discontinued) was probably my biggest project, with over 4 million downloads. Notable other projects include <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/afsu-mod">the AFSU Mod</a>, <a
				 href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flaxbeards-steam-power">Flaxbeard's Steam Power</a> (also known as Esteemed Innovation), <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-control">World Control</a>, <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/long-fall-boots">Long Fall Boots</a>, and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/huesodewiki">HuesoDeWiki</a>. All are written in Java.</p>
				 <p>Creating mods accidentally brought me far into the world of documenting mods. I am now an administrator of and major contributor (with over 50,000 edits) towards the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/FTB_Wiki">Official FTB Wiki</a>, the largest, most popular and most up-to-date centralized repostiory of knowledge on modded Minecraft. Because of classwork, I am only sporadically active, and current contributions are mostly administrative rather than writing new documentation. In August 2016, I was awarded <a href="https://help.gamepedia.com/Editor_of_the_Month">Gamepedia Editor of the Month</a> for my "hard work across Gamepedia."</p>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Technology expertise</h2>
				<!-- TODO: expand -->
				<p>Java is the programming language I feel most natural in. Groovy comes close, but only since they are quite similar. I'm not as skilled in Ruby, but I've always had a thing for it. Its biggest weakness for me is its lack of a decent, free IDE. I still use it to whip up a script when needed. I am also quite skilled in the usage of MediaWiki.</p>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Personal</h2>
				<p>I try to exercise every day. Previously I would run or lift weights each day, but because of the pandemic I am currently only running. I prefer to run long distances, usually 40-60 minutes a day. I've run three marathons, which I am very proud of. Once the pandemic is over, I hope to increase my milage and run a fourth.</p>
				<p>I like to play video games. Minecraft is my favorite, especially when modded. Other games I enjoy include League of Legends, Cube 2: Sauerbraten, The Madness of Little Emma, the Civilization series, and Bloons Tower Defense 6.</p>
				<p>I like to keep up with the news and with international politics and affairs (especially in Europe and Latin America, as well as parts of Asia and the Middle East). I like cats, and love my parents' cats, Trixie and Scout.</p>
