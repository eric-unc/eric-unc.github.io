		<p>My name is Eric Schneider. Welcome to my website.</p>
		<img src="eric.png" alt="A picture of myself" width="500" height="600">
		<p>I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am a double major in Computer Science (BS) and Political Science (BA), and minoring in Mathematics. I am curently a first-year.</p>
		<p>This website is pretty barebones, since web design is not my thing and I didn't want to use a tool. It's also lacking because I'm not very interesting. Anyway, you can learn more about me by clicking any of the links above.</p>
