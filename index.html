								<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Eric Schneider</strong> (<em>he/him</em>).</p>
								<p>I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and raised in Weddington, North Carolina. I am currently an undergraduate college student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am a double major in Computer Science (BS) and Mathematics (BS). I am a sophomore.</p>
								<p>Welcome to my website! This website is perpetually a work-in-progress, but it's mostly up-to-date. I am currently interested in summer opportunities for 2021.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Coursework and experience</h2>
				<p>In computer science, my course load is focused around major requirements (such as COMP 410: Data Structures and COMP 211: Systems Fundamentals), systems programming (such as COMP 520: Compilers), and also classes that are generally very useful (such as COMP 426: Modern Web Programming). In mathematics, my course load is focused around major requisites (such as MATH 383: First Course in Differential Equations). For mathematical electives, I hope to focus on scientific computation and mathematics relevant to the computer science field. All of the relevant classes I've taken are listed on my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
				<p>I am an undergraduate teaching assistant in Systems Fundamentals (COMP 211), an intermediate level computer science class. It teaches programming in the C language and lower-level computer concepts such as data representation, memory management, and parsing, as well as tools. With the help of Cindy Wang and Dylan Binley, I helped make <a href="https://comp211-20f.github.io/">a semester website</a>.</p>
				<p>I originally gained an appreciation for computer programming through <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Mods">Minecraft modding</a>. Although I am no longer especially active in the scene, I have created, taken over, or contributed towards several Minecraft mods used by many real players. <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclear-control-2">Nuclear Control 2</a> (now discontinued) is probably my biggest project, which has over 4.5 million downloads. Notable other projects include <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/afsu-mod">the AFSU Mod</a> (with 130k downloads), <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flaxbeards-steam-power">Flaxbeard's Steam Power</a> (also known as Esteemed Innovation, with 900k downloads), <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-control">World Control</a> (880k downloads), <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/long-fall-boots">Long Fall Boots</a> (11.6m downloads), and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/huesodewiki">HuesoDeWiki</a> (with 4k downloads). All are written in Java.</p>
				 <p>Creating mods accidentally brought me far into the world of documenting mods. I am now an administrator of and a major contributor (with over 50,000 edits) towards the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/FTB_Wiki">Official FTB Wiki</a>, the largest, most popular and most up-to-date centralized repository of knowledge on modded Minecraft. Because of classwork, I am only sporadically active, and current contributions are mostly administrative rather than writing new documentation. In August 2016, I was awarded <a href="https://help.gamepedia.com/Editor_of_the_Month">Gamepedia Editor of the Month</a> for my "hard work across Gamepedia."</p>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Technology expertise</h2>
				<!-- TODO: expand -->
				<p>Java is the programming language I feel the most natural in, as it is the first language I used when I decided to start programming in 2013, and I have used it in many projects since. I'm also fairly comfortable in Ruby, which is my scripting language of choice. I am also quite skilled in the usage of MediaWiki.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Personal</h2>
				<p>I run every day. Previously I would run and then lift weights on alternative days, but because of the pandemic I am currently only running. I prefer to run long distances, usually 40-60 minutes a day. I've run three marathons, which I am very proud of. Once the pandemic is over, I hope to increase my mileage and run a fourth.</p>
				<p>I like to play video games. Minecraft is my favorite, especially when modded. Other games I enjoy include League of Legends, Cube 2: Sauerbraten, The Madness of Little Emma, the Civilization series, and Bloons Tower Defense 6.</p>
				<p>I like to keep up with the news and with international politics and affairs. I like cats, and love my parents' cats, Trixie and Scout.</p>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Contact</h2>
				<p>If you want to contact me, you can contact me through email with the address <code>u 1 6 4 3 3 6 4 (at) live . unc . edu</code> (<a href="javascript:" class="copyemail">copy</a>). This is my student email, but I do check it almost every day, even outside of the school semester. Email is my preferred means of initial contact. I will not give out further contact information here.</p>
				<p>You can add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-schneider-cs/">LinkedIn</a>. You are welcome to contact me there but I don't check it often. Also, sometimes my information on LinkedIn is a bit dated.</p>
