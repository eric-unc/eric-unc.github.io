								<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Eric Schneider</strong> (<em>he/him</em>).</p>
								<p>I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am a double major in Computer Science (BS) and Mathematics (BS). I am curently a sophomore.</p>
								<p>This website is perpetually a work-in-progress, but it's mostly up-to-date. Anyway, you can learn more about me by clicking any of the links above.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Coursework and experience</h2>
				<p>In computer science, my course load is focused around prerequisites, required preparation for the <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/academics/graduate/ms-requirements/">Master of Science</a>, and classes that are generally very applicable (such as COMP 426: Modern Web Programming). In mathematics, my course load is focused around prerequisites. Once those are done, I am hoping to focus on scientific computation and mathematics relevant to the computer science field.</p>
				<p>I am an undergraduate teaching assistant in Systems Fundamentals (COMP 211), an intermediate level computer science class. It teaches programming in the C language and lower-level computer concepts such as data representation, memory management, and parsing, as well as tools.</p>
				<p>I originally gained an appreciation for computer programming through <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Mods">Minecraft modding</a>. Although I am no longer especially active in the scene, I have created, taken over, or contributed towards several Minecraft mods used by many real players. <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclear-control-2">Nuclear Control 2</a> (now discontinued) was probably my biggest project, with over 4 million downloads. Notable other projects include <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/afsu-mod">the AFSU Mod</a>, <a
				 href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flaxbeards-steam-power">Flaxbeard's Steam Power</a> (also known as Esteemed Innovation), <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-control">World Control</a>, <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/long-fall-boots">Long Fall Boots</a>, and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/huesodewiki">HuesoDeWiki</a>. All are written in Java.</p>
				 <p>Creating mods accidentally brought me far into the world of documenting mods. I am now an administrator of and major contributor (with over 50,000 edits) towards the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/FTB_Wiki">Official FTB Wiki</a>, the largest, most popular and most up-to-date centralized repostiory of knowledge on modded Minecraft. Because of classwork, I am only sporadically active, and current contributions are mostly administrative rather than writing new documentation.</p>
