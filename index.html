								<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Eric Schneider</strong> (<em>he/him</em>).</p>
								<p>I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and raised in Weddington, North Carolina. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 2023. I am a double major in Computer Science (BS) and Mathematics (BS).</p>
								<p>This summer, I am interning at VMware, where I am a Software Developer for VMware Uhana.</p>
								<p>Welcome to my website! It is usually up-to-date.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Coursework and experience</h2>
				<p>In computer science, my course load is focused around major requirements (such as COMP 410: Data Structures and COMP 211: Systems Fundamentals), systems programming (such as COMP 520: Compilers), and also applications (such as COMP 426: Modern Web Programming). In mathematics, my course load is focused around major requirements (such as MATH 383: First Course in Differential Equations), applications (such as MATH 528: Mathematical Methods for the Physical Sciences I), and classes related to computer science (such as MATH 548: Combinatorial Mathematics). The most relevant classes I've taken are listed on my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
				<p>I am an undergraduate teaching assistant in Systems Fundamentals (COMP 211), an intermediate level computer science class. It teaches programming in the C language and lower-level computer concepts such as data representation, memory management, and parsing, as well as tools. With the help of Cindy Wang and Dylan Binley, I helped make <a href="https://comp211-20f.github.io/">an archival semester website</a>.</p>
				<p>I originally gained an appreciation for computer programming through <a href="https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/Mods">Minecraft modding</a>. Although I am no longer as active in the scene, I have created, taken over, or contributed towards several Minecraft mods used by many real players. <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclear-control-2">Nuclear Control 2</a> (now discontinued) is probably my biggest project, which has about 5 million downloads. Notable other projects include <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/afsu-mod">the AFSU Mod</a> (with 155k downloads), <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flaxbeards-steam-power">Flaxbeard's Steam Power</a> (also known as Esteemed Innovation, with 935k downloads), <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-control">World Control</a> (981k downloads), <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/long-fall-boots">Long Fall Boots</a> (12.7m downloads), and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/huesodewiki">HuesoDeWiki</a> (with 4k downloads). All are written in Java.</p>
				 <p>Creating mods accidentally brought me deep into the world of documenting mods. I am now an administrator of and a major contributor (with over 50,000 edits) towards the <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/FTB_Wiki">Official FTB Wiki</a>, the largest, most popular and most up-to-date centralized repository of knowledge on modded Minecraft. Because of classwork, I am only sporadically active, and my current contributions are mostly administrative rather than writing new documentation. In August 2016, I was awarded <a href="https://help.gamepedia.com/Editor_of_the_Month">Gamepedia Editor of the Month</a> for my "hard work across Gamepedia."</p>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Technology expertise</h2>
				<p>Java is the programming language I feel the most natural in, since it is the first language I used when I started programming in 2013, and I have used it in many projects since. I am also fairly comfortable in Ruby, my scripting language of choice. Here are all of the languages and technologies I have experience with:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Strong</span>: Java, Ruby, MediaWiki.</li>
					<li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Basic</span>:
						<ul>
							<li>Languages: JavaScript, C, Groovy, HTML, CSS, SQL (SQLite, MariaDB).</li>
							<li>Tools/frameworks: Git, jQuery, Node.js, express.js, Linux, Apache Flink, Gradle, JUnit, Bulma.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Some</span>:
						<ul>
							<li>Languages: Lua, Python, C#, MATLAB, Mathematica, Racket, Rust, Assembly (MIPS).</li>
							<li>Tools/frameworks: Heroku, React.js, Bazel, Kubernetes, Kafka Streams.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can see how I've used this knowledge in <a href="projects.html">the projects I've made</a>.</p>
				<p>Generally I am quite flexible when it comes to languages and frameworks. I've touched enough of everything to be able to adopt to whatever situation I need to.</p>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Personal</h2>
				<p>I run every day. Before the pandemic, I would lift weights on alternative days. I prefer to run long distances, usually one to two hours a day. I've run three marathons, which I am very proud of. Once the pandemic is over, I plan to run a fourth.</p>
				<p>I like to play video games. Minecraft is my favorite, especially when modded. Other games I enjoy include League of Legends, Cube 2: Sauerbraten, The Madness of Little Emma, the Civilization series, and Bloons Tower Defense 6.</p>
				<p>I am interested in international politics and affairs, and I keep up with the news closely. I like cats, and love my parents' cats, Trixie and Scout.</p>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Contact</h2>
				<p>If you want to contact me, you can contact me through email with the address <code>u 1 6 4 3 3 6 4 (at) live . unc . edu</code> (<a href="javascript:" class="copyemail">copy</a>). This is my student email, but it is continually monitored outside of the school semester. Email is my preferred means of initial contact.</p>
				<p>You can add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-cs/">LinkedIn</a>. You are welcome to contact me there, but I don't check it as often. Also, sometimes my information on LinkedIn is a bit dated.</p>
