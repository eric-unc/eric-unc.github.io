				<p>My name is Eric Schneider (he/him). I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and raised near there. I am currently attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a sophmore.</p>
				<p>I am working to obtain a Bachelor's of Science in the majors of computer science and a mathematics. In computer science, I am currently mainly taking prerequisites. After those are done (should be roughly after fall), I plan to focus on classes that are required preparation for the Master of Science (see "Background Preparation," <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/academics/graduate/ms-requirements/">here</a>). In Mathematics, I'm mainly taking classes that are requirements for both my majors. I plan to take classes that are relevant to computer science and scientific computation after that.</p>
				<p>Computer science is the focus on my studies and what I hope to get a career in. I first started programming when I was 12 by copying online YouTube tutorials. Despite having been copied word-for-word, my first program did not work. Nevertheless I persisted, and eventually was good enough at programming to work on things that could be used by others. <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nuclear-control-2">Nuclear Control 2</a>, a port of a Minecraft mod I was the project leader and main programmer for, has over 4 million downloads. Although the mod is discontinued, I still get money from downloads, even if not much. The <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/FTB_Wiki">Official FTB Wiki</a>, which I am an administrator and major contributor towards (with over 50,000 edits), has effectively become the biggest, most popular and most up-to-date centralized repostiory of knowledge on modded Minecraft. I do not get money from it, although I did receive a job offer which I unfortunately had to turn down. For other projects I've worked on, see my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> or my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
				<p>Java is the programming language I feel most natural in. Groovy comes close, but only since they are quite similar. I'm not as skilled in Ruby, but I've always had a thing for it. Its biggest weakness for me is its lack of a decent, free IDE. I still use it to whip up a script when needed. I am also quite skilled in the usage of MediaWiki.</p>
				<p>I am openly bisexual.</p>
				<p>In in my free time, I like to run and lift weights. I'm not very fast, but I can run long distances. I've run three marathons, which I am very proud of. I like to play video games. Minecraft is my favorite, especially when modded. League of Legends is a favorite too, although I haven't played it as much recently. Other games I enjoy include Cube 2: Sauerbraten, The Madness of Little Emma, the Civilization series, and the Bloons Tower Defense series. Other than gaming, I like to keep up with the news and with international politics. I like cats, including the two my parents own.</p>
				<h2 class="subtitle">Awards and Honors</h2>
				<p>I haven't received a Nobel yet, but I'm working on it.</p>
