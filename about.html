		<h1 id="title">About</h1>
		<p>My name is Eric Schneider. I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and raised near there. I am currently attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a first-year.</p>
		<p>I am working to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, as well as a minor in Mathematics. In Computer Science, I am just taking prerequisites right now. After those are done (should be around next year), I plan to focus on classes that are required preparation for the Master of Science (see "Background Preparation," <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/academics/graduate/ms-requirements/">here</a>). In Political Science, I am focusing on either international affairs or theory, or possibly both. In Mathematics, I'm taking mainly what's required for the minor and the Computer Science BS.</p>
		<p>Although I enjoy learning about political science, computer science is where I see my future career being. I started programming at the age of 12, which sounds pretty impressive, but at that point I was mostly just copying tutorials off YouTube. Nevertheless I persisted, and eventually was good enough at programming to work on stuff that could be used by others. Java is the programming language I feel most natural in. Groovy is a close tie, but it help those languages are quite similar. I haven't used it much recently but I've always had a thing for Ruby; its only weakness for me is its lack of a decent, free IDE. I am also pretty skilled in the usage of MediaWiki.</p>
		<h2>Awards and Honors</h2>
		<p>I haven't received a Nobel yet, but I'm working on it.</p>
